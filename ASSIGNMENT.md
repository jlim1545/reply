# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> One aspect of the module's code that help me to understand the code easier was the variable names and function names. By naming functions and variables based on their behaviors, I had easier time understanding what they do. One change that would have made it easier to understand is to add inline comment on the conditions that some methods are using. Since a lot of conditions used regex for conditional statement and lacked explanation of what that specific conditional check it is doing, I had hard time understanding what checks were being made.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> I would say effective comment is way of explaining the behavior of the a program without talking about how program is behaving. The effective comment comes from explaining using abstraction not implementation details. For example, instead of using specific data structure and specific algorithm to explain how the program function, one should use generalize the behavior of the function using languages understood by everyone.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> It took me about 5 hours to complete this assignment. It took me a while to understand what was going on in the code


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I have received help from jooneil Ahn. He taught me how to follow JSDoc commenting style. 


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> One problem that I encountered in this assignment was that understanding some of the code in the public npm libraries were hard to understand with basic node.js knowledge. It will be better if this assignment was given later in the future where the students have sufficient knowledgein node.js
